We are living in a world few could have imagined a few decades ago. What will the workforce and workplace look like half a century from now?
My research question will focus on the following topics:
How will we maintain a work/life balance when more and more people are working remotely. We are easily accessible through our phones, computers, SLACK, email, facetime, IM’ing etc… where do we draw the line when we are not at work? How will we maintain work/life and family balance? Will employers expect us to be “always on?”
Secondly, as technology continues to spread, I can’t help but wonder: What are we losing as a society? What is the effect on social relationships? Work, after all, is more than just a job or paycheck. It is where we meet friends, share ideas, and build a common sense of purpose, community  and a social network. With voice mail, e-mail, and cloud-based software , how do we preserve the human network and the social interaction that work has helped to facilitate? What takes its place?
